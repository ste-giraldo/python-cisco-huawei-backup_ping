# python-cisco-huawei-backup_ping
Script for backup cisco and huawei configs, with ping host check

#cisco_backup_v0.3p.py version with hosts list from external file "cisco_backup_hosts". It also use static (in script) or prompted authentication. It also include a ping test to check if the hosts are up or not. At the moment is a little buggy, need to work again on the code. Any contribution on the ping test are appreciated.
